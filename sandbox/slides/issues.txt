The 2x3 and 3x2 layouts should be selected better. It can overflow now, 
check it with desktop portrait. JS will be the solution?

+ Menubar is probably not centered anymore

+ The images should be at least centered.

+ The album cover image should be sized dynamically. (iPhone)
  Remove the flexbox, probably not necessary, and then the fitted image
  will be always on the top

+ However, move this flexbox solution to another sandbox project: This 
  is how I will center the flexbox of the slide images.

+ Colors: darkgreen, green, lightgreen; does not look good.
